# Updated Suitability Assessment for CTRL-1077231

## Reasonableness of Data

**Determine if the data source used for the measurement is complete, accurate, and timely.**
**Identify any gaps or known defects in the data source as applicable.**
**Is the data source covered by data usage agreement? If not, does it need to be?**

### Response

CMT utilizes the following fields and endpoints from the CloudRadar API to calculate control measurements. Data is requested from the CloudRadar API via a CMT Databricks job at 6:30AM ET daily.

#### Primary Data Sources:

**Summary Endpoint Validation (`https://api.cloud.capitalone.com/internal-operations/cloud-service/aws-tooling/summary-view`):**
- **"resourceType": "AWS::EC2::Instance"** - Filters for all AWS EC2 instances catalogued in CloudRadar to establish baseline population count
- **"configuration.metadataOptions.httpTokens": "required"** - Provides summary count of compliant instances for validation purposes
- **Purpose**: Cross-validation to ensure data consistency between endpoints and early detection of API availability issues

**Configuration Details Endpoint (`https://api.cloud.capitalone.com/internal-operations/cloud-service/aws-tooling/search-resource-configurations`):**

*For Tier 1 Measurement:*
- **"resourceType": "AWS::EC2::Instance"** - Retrieves detailed configuration for all AWS EC2 instances
- **configurationList analysis** - Searches for items where configurationName = "configuration.metadataOptions.httpTokens" and configurationValue is non-empty
- **Response fields**: accountName, amazonResourceName, resourceId, resourceType, awsRegion, configurationList

*For Tier 2 Measurement:*
- **Same resource population as Tier 1** - Processes instances that passed Tier 1 criteria (have non-empty httpTokens configuration)
- **Configuration value validation** - Counts instances where configurationValue exactly equals "required"

#### Implementation Validation and Quality Controls:

**Multi-Stage Validation Process:**
1. **Summary Endpoint Validation**: Ensures API connectivity and retrieves basic resource counts for cross-validation
2. **Limited Resource Fetch**: Validates with first 1000 instances to verify configuration field availability and extraction logic
3. **Sample Analysis**: Examines first 5 resources to confirm field structure and identify potential data issues
4. **Configuration Validation**: Verifies that httpTokens fields are extractable before full processing
5. **Cross-Validation**: Compares summary counts with detailed resource counts to detect data inconsistencies

**Data Processing Logic:**
- **Tier 1 Processing**: Iterates through all EC2 instances, searches configurationList arrays for "configuration.metadataOptions.httpTokens", counts instances with non-empty values regardless of actual value
- **Tier 2 Processing**: Processes only Tier 1-compliant instances (those with any httpTokens value), counts those with configurationValue exactly equal to "required"
- **Error Handling**: Conservative approach with script termination on validation failures to prevent inaccurate reporting

**Data Quality and Reliability Measures:**
- **API Management**: Implements exponential backoff retry logic (up to 3 retries) for API failures, rate limiting protection with 429 status code handling, and timeout handling (60 seconds default)
- **Pagination Handling**: Processes large datasets using nextRecordKey pagination with 10,000 record limits per request
- **Validation Gates**: Automatic abort with manual intervention required if no resources are retrieved from summary endpoints or if configuration field extraction fails
- **Data Consistency Checks**: Cross-validation between different API endpoints and early termination if significant discrepancies are detected

**Data Reliability Considerations:**
- **Real-time Data**: CloudRadar provides current EC2 instance configurations, ensuring measurements reflect actual state at time of execution
- **Field Structure Dependency**: Relies on consistent configurationList structure and field naming conventions in CloudRadar API responses
- **Conservative Error Handling**: Script prioritizes accuracy over availability, terminating execution rather than producing potentially incorrect metrics when data quality issues are detected

#### Data Usage Agreement Status:
CMT is currently onboarding to AXT's Enterprise Tech Insights Platform (ETIP), where we are implementing a data producer agreement (DPA) to cover data source changes. The DPA will document procedures with responsibilities outlined for both the data consumer (CMT) and provider (control owners).

**Current Dependencies Requiring DPA Coverage:**
- CloudRadar API availability and data structure consistency
- Summary-view and search-resource-configurations endpoint synchronization
- Threshold configuration data from `CYBR_DB_COLLAB.LAB_ESRA_TCRD.CYBER_CONTROLS_MONITORING_THRESHOLD`
- Databricks job execution environment and scheduling reliability

**Operational Contingencies:**
Due to the nature of retrieving real-time data from the CloudRadar API, if CTRL-1077231 measurements fail to be calculated on a given day because of API issues or validation failures, CMT will carry over the last successfully calculated measurements for that day and trigger manual investigation.

## Verify Appropriate Metric Thresholding

**If the measurement is medium or high maturity:**
**Determine specific measurement thresholds for Green, Yellow, and Red status levels.**
**All thresholds must be discussed with and approved by the control owner(s)/SME(s).**

### Response

CMT has established the following thresholds for each measurement tier, configured in Snowflake table `CYBR_DB_COLLAB.LAB_ESRA_TCRD.CYBER_CONTROLS_MONITORING_THRESHOLD` and retrievable via the monitoring script:

#### Tier 1 Measurement ("Configuration Coverage") - MNTR-1077231-T1:
- **Green Status (100%)**: All AWS EC2 instances maintain any value in the 'configuration.metadataOptions.httpTokens' field, indicating the field is available for IMDSv2 enforcement monitoring
- **Red Status (<100%)**: One or more EC2 instances lack the httpTokens configuration field, creating blind spots in IMDSv2 compliance monitoring

**Rationale**: The 100% threshold is appropriate because all EC2 instances should maintain this configuration field to enable IMDSv2 policy enforcement. Any instances without this field cannot be properly monitored or controlled for IMDSv2 compliance, representing a security monitoring gap.

#### Tier 2 Measurement ("IMDSv2 Compliance") - MNTR-1077231-T2:
- **Green Status (100%)**: All EC2 instances with httpTokens configuration maintain the value 'required', ensuring exclusive IMDSv2 usage
- **Red Status (<100%)**: One or more instances with httpTokens configuration do not have the value set to 'required', allowing potential IMDSv1 usage

**Rationale**: The 100% threshold is appropriate because all EC2 instances are required to enforce IMDSv2-only access to remain compliant with CTRL-1077231. Any instance allowing IMDSv1 access represents a direct security policy violation requiring immediate attention.

#### Threshold Configuration and Management:
- **Dynamic Retrieval**: Thresholds are retrieved from Snowflake configuration table during each measurement execution
- **Fallback Values**: Default 100% thresholds are applied for both tiers if configuration table is unavailable
- **Status Implementation**: The system uses a three-tier status model (Green/Yellow/Red) with configurable warning thresholds, though current configuration implements binary Green/Red operation with no Yellow warning thresholds defined
- **Threshold Validation**: Script includes threshold loading validation with fallback to conservative defaults to ensure reliable compliance reporting

#### Historical Performance Context:
Since April 2nd, 2025, the average value of both Tier 1 and Tier 2 measurements has been 100%, supporting the appropriateness of the 100% threshold levels. This consistent performance indicates that:
- EC2 instances consistently maintain the required configuration fields
- IMDSv2 enforcement is effectively implemented across the infrastructure
- The thresholds appropriately distinguish between compliant and non-compliant states

#### Future Enhancement Considerations:
CMT plans to implement Orange status thresholds as initial indicators of potential control failures prior to verification with control owners. If verification confirms that an Orange status represents a genuine control failure, the status will be escalated to Red. Red measurements will return to Green status only when control failures are remediated and measurements exceed the established Green thresholds.

## Ensure Measurement Meets Objective/Intent

**What is the purpose of the measurement? What is measured?**
**Confirm measurement maturity level and production readiness.**

### Response

#### Current Maturity Level: Medium
The measurements have clearly defined intents and purposes, have been successfully tested, and are operational in the CMT internal Databricks environment. The two-tier measurement approach comprehensively monitors CTRL-1077231 effectiveness for IMDSv2 enforcement across AWS EC2 infrastructure.

#### Control Context and Security Objective:
CTRL-1077231 ensures that all AWS EC2 instances enforce exclusive use of Instance Metadata Service version 2 (IMDSv2), which provides enhanced security protections against Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks and other metadata service abuse vectors. IMDSv2 requires session tokens for metadata access, preventing unauthorized applications from accessing sensitive instance metadata.

#### Tier 1 Measurement (MNTR-1077231-T1) - "Configuration Coverage"
**Purpose**: Validates monitoring system coverage to ensure comprehensive visibility into EC2 instance IMDSv2 configuration status

**What is Measured**: Percentage of AWS EC2 instances maintaining any value in the 'configuration.metadataOptions.httpTokens' field, calculated as:
- **Numerator**: Count of EC2 instances with non-empty httpTokens configuration field  
- **Denominator**: Total count of active AWS EC2 instances retrieved from CloudRadar API

**Detailed Logic**: For each EC2 instance, the measurement searches the configurationList for items where configurationName = "configuration.metadataOptions.httpTokens" and counts instances where configurationValue exists and is non-empty, regardless of the actual value content.

**Value**: Ensures the control monitoring system has complete visibility into the EC2 population that can be managed for IMDSv2 compliance, preventing blind spots that could hide non-compliant instances.

#### Tier 2 Measurement (MNTR-1077231-T2) - "IMDSv2 Enforcement Compliance"
**Purpose**: Measures actual compliance with IMDSv2-only enforcement requirements across the monitored EC2 population

**What is Measured**: Percentage of configurable EC2 instances that enforce IMDSv2-only access, calculated as:
- **Numerator**: Count of instances where httpTokens configuration value exactly equals "required"
- **Denominator**: Count of instances with any httpTokens configuration value (Tier 1 numerator)

**Detailed Logic**: Processes only instances that passed Tier 1 criteria (have non-empty httpTokens configuration), then counts those where the configurationValue is precisely "required", which enforces IMDSv2-only access and blocks IMDSv1 requests.

**Value**: Provides direct measurement of security policy compliance, ensuring all manageable EC2 instances prevent unauthorized metadata access through legacy IMDSv1 protocols.

#### Implementation Quality Assurance:
**Multi-Stage Validation Framework**:
- **Pre-execution Validation**: Sample-based verification of API connectivity, field availability, and data structure consistency
- **Cross-endpoint Validation**: Comparison between summary and detailed API endpoints to detect data inconsistencies  
- **Configuration Extraction Testing**: Verification that httpTokens fields are correctly extractable from configurationList structures
- **Conservative Failure Handling**: Script termination rather than potentially inaccurate reporting when validation issues are detected

**Data Processing Reliability**:
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Exponential backoff, rate limiting protection, and timeout management for API interactions
- **Resource Pagination**: Efficient handling of large datasets with proper nextRecordKey management
- **Validation Gates**: Multiple checkpoints to ensure data quality before metric calculation
- **Threshold Integration**: Dynamic threshold loading with fallback mechanisms to ensure reliable compliance assessment

#### Supporting Evidence and Operational Value:
- **Tier 1 Evidence**: Details EC2 instances lacking httpTokens configuration fields, enabling targeted remediation of monitoring gaps
- **Tier 2 Evidence**: Identifies specific instances with non-compliant httpTokens values, providing actionable compliance remediation targets
- **Historical Trending**: Since April 2025, consistent 100% performance demonstrates effective control implementation and validates threshold appropriateness

#### Medium Maturity Criteria Compliance:
✅ **Clearly Defined Intent**: Both tiers have specific, security-focused purposes aligned with IMDSv2 enforcement objectives  
✅ **Reliable Implementation**: Comprehensive validation and error handling ensure accurate, conservative reporting  
✅ **Operational Testing**: Successfully running in Databricks environment with proven data processing capabilities  
✅ **Early Warning Capability**: Tier 1 provides coverage monitoring, Tier 2 enables immediate compliance detection  
✅ **Threshold-Based Assessment**: Established Green/Red status framework with dynamic configuration management  
✅ **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed technical implementation and operational procedures documented  

#### Areas for High Maturity Enhancement:
- **Historical Baseline Development**: Establish trend analysis and performance baseline metrics over extended operational periods
- **Automated Escalation Integration**: Enhance threshold breach protocols with automated notification and remediation workflows  
- **Control Owner Validation Process**: Formalize control owner approval workflows for threshold modifications and measurement methodology changes
- **ETIP Platform Integration**: Complete migration to Enterprise Tech Insights Platform for enhanced monitoring and reporting capabilities

#### Conclusion:
These measurements effectively monitor CTRL-1077231 at medium maturity level, providing comprehensive coverage of IMDSv2 configuration monitoring (Tier 1) and enforcement compliance (Tier 2). The two-tier approach ensures both monitoring system reliability and direct security policy compliance assessment. The implemented validation framework and conservative error handling make the measurements suitable for production monitoring while the established thresholds appropriately balance security requirements with operational realities. The measurements will be enhanced to high maturity as part of the ongoing ETIP onboarding and operational maturation process.
