# Updated Suitability Assessment for CTRL-1077188

## Reasonableness of Data

**Determine if the data source used for the measurement is complete, accurate, and timely.**
**Identify any gaps or known defects in the data source as applicable.**
**Is the data source covered by data usage agreement? If not, does it need to be?**

### Response

The following data fields and sources are used across the three-tier measurement approach:

#### Tier 0 (Heartbeat Measurement) Data Sources:
From Snowflake view `CYBR_DB.PHDP_CYBR.CERTIFICATE_CATALOG_CERTIFICATE_USAGE`:
- **CERTIFICATE_ID** and **CERTIFICATE_ARN** to uniquely identify each ACM TLS certificate being analyzed
- **NOT_VALID_AFTER_UTC_TIMESTAMP** to determine certificate expiration dates
- **LAST_USAGE_OBSERVATION_UTC_TIMESTAMP** to identify when certificates were last used, particularly after expiration
- **NOT_VALID_BEFORE_UTC_TIMESTAMP** (via LEAD window function) to determine if proper rotation occurred after expiration

**Tier 0 Logic**: The measurement identifies certificates that expired within the last 3 days and were used after expiration WITHOUT proper rotation. This captures actual control failures rather than normal rotation processes where brief gaps might occur.

#### Tier 1 (Completeness Measurement) Data Sources:
**From Snowflake view `CYBR_DB.PHDP_CYBR.CERTIFICATE_CATALOG_CERTIFICATE_USAGE`:**
- **CERTIFICATE_ARN** to uniquely identify ACM TLS certificates (filtered by 'arn:aws:acm' pattern)
- **NOMINAL_ISSUER** to filter for certificates issued by 'Amazon'
- **NOT_VALID_AFTER_UTC_TIMESTAMP** to include certificates with expiration dates within the past year

**From CloudRadar API endpoint `https://api.cloud.capitalone.com/internal-operations/cloud-service/aws-tooling/search-resource-configurations`:**
- **amazonResourceName** field to uniquely identify certificates for comparison
- **source** field to filter out orphaned certificates (excludes "CT-AccessDenied")
- **status** field to exclude certificates in transitional states ("PENDING_DELETION", "PENDING_IMPORT")
- Search parameters include:
  - resourceType: "AWS::ACM::Certificate"
  - issuer: "Amazon"
  - renewalStatus: "SUCCESS"  
  - Specific tags for ASVACMAUTOMATION certificates

**Tier 1 Logic**: Compares in-scope certificates from CloudRadar API against the Snowflake dataset using case-insensitive ARN matching to determine data completeness coverage.

#### Tier 2 (Accuracy Measurement) Data Sources:
From Snowflake view `CYBR_DB.PHDP_CYBR.CERTIFICATE_CATALOG_CERTIFICATE_USAGE`:
- **CERTIFICATE_ID** to count unique compliant certificates
- **CERTIFICATE_ARN** for certificate identification
- **NOT_VALID_AFTER_UTC_TIMESTAMP** and **NOT_VALID_BEFORE_UTC_TIMESTAMP** to calculate certificate lifetime
- **LAST_USAGE_OBSERVATION_UTC_TIMESTAMP** to identify usage past expiration

**Tier 2 Logic**: Identifies non-compliant certificates based on two criteria:
1. Certificates used after their expiration date
2. Certificates with lifetime exceeding 395 days (~13 months maximum policy)

#### Data Quality and Reliability Considerations:
- **Error Handling**: Script defaults to "Red" compliance status when data sources are unavailable, ensuring conservative reporting
- **API Management**: Implements pagination (10,000 record limits), rate limiting (0.15-second delays), and timeout handling (60 seconds)
- **Performance Optimization**: Non-compliant resource details limited to 100 entries with indication when more exist
- **Data Matching**: Case-insensitive ARN comparison between data sources for reliable matching

#### Data Usage Agreement Status:
CMT is currently onboarding to AXT's Enterprise Tech Insights Platform (ETIP), where we are implementing a data producer agreement (DPA) to cover data source changes. In the event that data sources are modified (e.g., frequency of table updates changes or stops), CMT will be notified in a timely manner to understand impact to control measurements. The DPA will document procedures with responsibilities outlined for both the data consumer (CMT) and provider (control owners).

**Current Dependencies Requiring DPA Coverage:**
- Snowflake certificate catalog updates and availability
- CloudRadar API availability and data accuracy
- Threshold configuration data from `CYBR_DB_COLLAB.LAB_ESRA_TCRD.CYBER_CONTROLS_MONITORING_THRESHOLD`

## Verify Appropriate Metric Thresholding

**If the measurement is medium or high maturity:**
**Determine specific measurement thresholds for Green, Yellow, and Red status levels.**
**All thresholds must be discussed with and approved by the control owner(s)/SME(s).**

### Response

CMT has established the following thresholds for each measurement tier, stored in the Snowflake table `CYBR_DB_COLLAB.LAB_ESRA_TCRD.CYBER_CONTROLS_MONITORING_THRESHOLD`:

#### Tier 0 Measurement ("Heartbeat") - MNTR-1077188-T0:
- **Green Status (100%)**: No ACM TLS certificates have been used past their expiration date without proper rotation
- **Red Status (0%)**: One or more ACM TLS certificates have been used past expiration without rotation, indicating control execution failure

**Rationale**: This binary threshold is appropriate since any certificate used past expiration without rotation represents a control failure requiring immediate attention.

#### Tier 1 Measurement ("Completeness") - MNTR-1077188-T1:
- **Green Status (≥95%)**: 95% or more of valid ACM TLS certificates in CloudRadar are present in the certificate rotation dataset
- **Yellow Status (90-94.9%)**: Between 90-95% of certificates are covered, indicating potential data completeness issues requiring monitoring
- **Red Status (<90%)**: Less than 90% coverage indicates significant data gaps requiring immediate investigation

**Rationale**: While 100% coverage is ideal, the 95% threshold accounts for operational realities such as brief delays in data synchronization, new certificate provisioning, or legitimate certificate exclusions while maintaining high coverage expectations.

#### Tier 2 Measurement ("Accuracy") - MNTR-1077188-T2:
- **Green Status (≥95%)**: 95% or more of ACM TLS certificates meet rotation compliance requirements (not used past expiration AND lifetime ≤395 days)
- **Yellow Status (90-94.9%)**: Between 90-95% compliance, indicating emerging rotation issues requiring attention
- **Red Status (<90%)**: Less than 90% compliance indicates significant rotation failures requiring immediate remediation

**Rationale**: The 95% threshold recognizes that while automatic rotation should achieve near-perfect compliance, operational factors such as certificate dependencies, maintenance windows, or edge cases may occasionally cause brief compliance gaps.

#### Threshold Configuration and Management:
- **Dynamic Retrieval**: Thresholds are retrieved from Snowflake configuration table during each measurement execution
- **Fallback Values**: Default thresholds are applied if configuration is unavailable (Tier 0: 100%, Tier 1&2: 95% alert/90% warning)
- **Future Enhancement**: Orange status thresholds will be added as initial indicators before Red status confirmation with control owners

## Ensure Measurement Meets Objective/Intent

**What is the purpose of the measurement? What is measured?**
**Confirm measurement maturity level and production readiness.**

### Response

#### Current Maturity Level: Medium
The measurements have clearly defined intents and purposes, have been successfully tested, and are running in the internal dashboard. The following tiered approach comprehensively monitors CTRL-1077188 effectiveness:

#### Tier 0 Measurement (MNTR-1077188-T0) - "Heartbeat"
**Purpose**: Binary indicator of control execution to detect immediate control failures

**What is Measured**: Identifies ACM TLS certificates that have been used past their expiration date without proper rotation within the last 3 days. The measurement specifically looks for certificates where:
- Certificate expired within the last 3 days
- Certificate was used after expiration  
- No subsequent rotation occurred, or rotation happened after expiration

**Value**: Provides immediate detection of control execution failures, serving as an early warning system for certificate-related security incidents.

#### Tier 1 Measurement (MNTR-1077188-T1) - "Completeness"  
**Purpose**: Validates data coverage to ensure the monitoring system captures the full certificate population

**What is Measured**: Percentage of in-scope ACM TLS certificates (from CloudRadar API) that are present in the certificate rotation dataset (Snowflake). In-scope certificates are defined as:
- AWS ACM certificates issued by Amazon
- Certificates with successful renewal status
- Certificates tagged for ASVACMAUTOMATION
- Excluding orphaned certificates and those in transitional states

**Value**: Ensures the control monitoring has comprehensive visibility into the certificate population, preventing blind spots that could hide compliance issues.

#### Tier 2 Measurement (MNTR-1077188-T2) - "Accuracy"
**Purpose**: Measures actual compliance with certificate rotation requirements

**What is Measured**: Percentage of ACM TLS certificates meeting both compliance criteria:
1. **Rotation Timeliness**: Certificates have not been used past their expiration date
2. **Lifetime Limits**: Certificate lifetime does not exceed 395 days (~13 months), enforcing the maximum certificate age policy

**Value**: Provides comprehensive assessment of certificate rotation compliance, ensuring both timely rotation and adherence to certificate lifetime policies.

#### Supporting Evidence and Reporting:
- **Tier 0**: Provides ARNs, rotation statuses, expiration dates, and validity periods for certificates with recent activity
- **Tier 1**: Details certificates present in CloudRadar but missing from the rotation dataset
- **Tier 2**: Lists non-compliant certificates with specific violation reasons (used past expiration, lifetime exceeded)

#### Medium Maturity Criteria Compliance:
✅ **Clearly Defined Intent**: Each tier has specific, documented purposes aligned with control objectives  
✅ **Reliable Implementation**: Error handling ensures conservative compliance reporting  
✅ **Tested and Operational**: Successfully running in internal dashboard environment  
✅ **Early Warning Capability**: Tier 0 provides immediate failure detection  
✅ **Threshold-Based Monitoring**: Established Green/Yellow/Red status framework  
✅ **Documentation Available**: Comprehensive technical and operational documentation  

#### Areas for Enhancement (Future High Maturity):
- **Data Freshness Validation**: Implement explicit validation of dataset update frequency
- **Historical Trending**: Develop baseline performance metrics over time  
- **Automated Escalation**: Enhance threshold breach protocols and automated notifications
- **Control Owner Integration**: Formalize control owner approval process for threshold modifications

#### Conclusion:
These measurements effectively monitor CTRL-1077188 at a medium maturity level, providing comprehensive coverage of control execution (Tier 0), data completeness (Tier 1), and compliance accuracy (Tier 2). The tiered approach ensures robust monitoring while the implemented thresholds balance operational realities with security requirements. The measurements are suitable for production monitoring and will be enhanced to high maturity as part of the ETIP onboarding process.
