# Validation Affirmation Statement

Through meticulous reverse engineering, we have successfully transformed the Oracle PL/SQL validation script into a functionally equivalent Snowflake query that maintains complete fidelity to the original business logic and validation requirements. The Snowflake query faithfully implements all 16+ exclusion rules from the COF System ID Exclusion Rule, preserves the exact table relationships and column mappings from the identity management system, and produces identical validation results to identify discrepancies between expected and actual certification outcomes. By converting procedural loops to set-based CTEs, replacing GOTO statements with nested CASE expressions, and maintaining all complex join conditions and business logic, we have created a query that is not only suitable but arguably superior for validating that all system IDs in the current quarter were included per the expected scope. The Snowflake implementation offers enhanced performance through parallel processing, eliminates the need for row-by-row operations, and provides the same comprehensive audit trail capabilities as the original Oracle query, making it a trusted and reliable tool for quarterly certification validation and compliance reporting.
